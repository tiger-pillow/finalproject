This gives us a variety of information about the ancestral character
reconstructions:

  - `$ace` contains the reconstructed ancestral character states. There
    is one value per internal node, and they are in the order that the
    internal nodes are numbered in.
  - `$sigma2` is the estimate of the Brownian Motion parameter.
  - `$CI95` are the confidence intervales on the ancestral character
    state reconstructions.
